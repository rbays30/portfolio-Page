    <div class="container-fluid px-5 py-2">
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio work from Harvard University's 
        esteemed CS50 course, where I had the incredible opportunity 
        to tackle a myriad of fascinating projects that showcase my 
        versatility and growth as a developer. Among the numerous 
        projects I undertook, I have carefully handpicked a select 
        few to present here, each representing a distinct aspect of 
        my skill set.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "credit" program stands as a testament to my C programming 
        proficiency, providing a simple yet efficient credit card 
        validator. In "dna," I ventured into the world of Python, 
        creating a program that skillfully sorts through lengthy 
        strings of DNA to match users from a sample database.
    </p>
    <p>
        With "finance," I delved into web development using Flask, 
        crafting a feature-rich application that interacts with the 
        IEX cloud API to pull real stock prices and simulate buying 
        and selling stocks, all while incorporating user authentication 
        and transaction history.

        The "reverse" program demonstrates my aptitude for manipulating 
        audio data, as I skillfully reverse a given WAV file. In 
        "speller," a C program, I honed my algorithmic skills, 
        implementing a hash table to efficiently spellcheck vast 
        collections of text.
    </p>
    <p>
        Taking on "tideman," I dived into election simulations, mastering 
        the tideman method. "Wordle" showcases my C prowess once again, 
        emulating the beloved word game with precision and flair.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lastly, my "World Cup" project in Python reveals my ability to 
        simulate complex scenarios, enabling me to predict World Cup 
        winners based on team rankings.
    </p>
    <p> Progressing through CS50 has been an exhilarating journey, 
        presenting me with an array of diverse challenges that have 
        shaped me into a well-rounded and skilled developer. I am 
        excited to share these accomplishments, each reflecting the 
        passion and dedication I poured into honing my craft during 
        this exceptional learning experience.
