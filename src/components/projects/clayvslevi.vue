    <div class="container-fluid px-5 py-3">
        <p>
            Welcome to Clay Vs. Levi - a dynamic Flutter project 
            that highlights my proficiency in web application 
            development and commitment to exceptional user experience. 
            This project provided an exhilarating opportunity to 
            create an application dedicated to tracking the intense 
            video game rivalry between my friend Clay and me. As an 
            avid gamer and developer, I meticulously crafted this app 
            to not only log our scores but also to deliver an engaging 
            and user-friendly experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Utilizing the robust capabilities of Flutter, I developed 
            a cross-platform application that ensures consistent and 
            smooth performance on both iOS and Android devices. The 
            result is a visually appealing and highly intuitive app 
            that captures the essence of our competitive spirit. 
            Deployed using Firebase for backend services, the app 
            boasts real-time data synchronization, making our rivalry 
            stats instantly accessible.

            input scores, view detailed statistics, and track progress 
            over time. The app incorporates Flutter's rich set of 
            pre-designed widgets, ensuring a polished and responsive 
            design.

            The feedback from our gaming sessions drives continuous 
            improvements in the app. Features such as real-time 
            notifications and a leaderboard
            enhance the competitive atmosphere. Witnessing our gaming 
            rivalry documented so precisely has been immensely 
            satisfying and motivates me to keep refining the user 
            experience.
