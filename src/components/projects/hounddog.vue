                Welcome to Hound Dog, an impressive C# application that I 
                had the privilege of creating during my time with a previous 
                employer and am now excited to share with you. Hound Dog 
                emerged from the desire to revolutionize information 
                gathering and visibility within our organization. 
                Working solo on this project, I embarked on a journey of 
                continuous learning, acquiring the necessary skills as I 
                progressed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Powered by C# and seamlessly integrated with a SQL server, 
                Hound Dog efficiently retrieves and presents critical data, 
                streamlining the process of accessing essential information. 
                Its primary objective was to bolster the accuracy of our 
                decision-making processes, and it succeeded admirably in 
                doing so. By employing regex expressions, the program 
                meticulously sorted through various work orders, deftly 
                highlighting discrepancies between the engineering BOM and 
                the implemented logic for the BOM.

            </p>
            <p>
                This innovative feature eliminated the need to search for 
                information in multiple places, allowing our team to work 
                faster and more efficiently. Hound Dog proved to be an 
                invaluable asset, simplifying complex tasks and enabling 
                us to focus on what truly mattered - making precise and 
                informed decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am delighted to share Hound Dog with you, and I hope it 
                becomes an indispensable tool in your workflow, just as it 
                has been for us. Let its intelligent capabilities guide you
                to greater accuracy and efficiency in your endeavors, 
                leaving you with more time to drive success in your projects.
